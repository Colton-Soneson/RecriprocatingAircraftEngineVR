NOTES
Engine Bore/Stroke/Displacement is based off of the Rotax 192, but designed like the Lycoming O-235. The Lycoming O-235 is found
in the Cessna 152, and has been manufactured from 1942 to present day. The 235 was choosen for its simplicity, and abundance of
information including Diagrams, wiring layouts, and exploded part views. The Rotax 192 uses smaller cylinders though (I believe)

The following are the parts that need to be modeled:
- Engine Block, cylinder head bolts
- Cylinder heads
- Pistons, Rods, Rings, End Caps, Bearings
- Crankshaft, camshaft, connecting gears (crank to cam and cam to magnetos)
- intake, exhaust, heater
- starter, magnetos, magneto wires, sparkplugs, spark wires
- oil pan, lubrication parts, oil pump
- valves, push rods, lifters, valve springs
- flywheel, prop connect, prop
- throttle cable, throttle plate, throttle housing, throttle to fuel hub connect
- fuel hub, injector fuel lines, line to cylinder head connect

The following are core features, must haves:
- Parts can not clip each other, clearances can be oversized to prevent this
- All engine parts modeled
- The animation
	+ Engine turns over
	+ Engine translates each part in exploded view, in order of disassembly
	+ Engine implodes together and rotates once more, this time with x-ray
	+ Loop

The following are reach features:
- Bring the animation to VR
- Place together parts yourself in VR
- button/ lever panel in VR to Start engine, choose magnetos (visualize powered lines), and fuel mixture


Engine Block:
- Specs (rounded):
	+ Bore			80mm
	+ Stroke		60mm
	+ Displacement	1206cc
- For Stoke, take TDC position - 60mm, but knowing connecting rod length means to have both banks set up at the same time
- Bore doesn't matter too much, just need to get the diameter of the cylinder wall correct
- use a flatplane crankshaft design, makes it easier to have the crankpins rest in a single flat line

Electric System:
- Two Spark plugs per cylinder, for redundancy, each connects to a different magneto
- Two magnetos, Left and Right, just run from a gear directly off of the camshaft

Fuel System:


Air System:


Lubrication System:


Intake/Exhaust System:
- two valves, just one intake and on exhaust

Cylinder Heads:


Misc:
